# Hello World

Lab 12: The reasoning on why I liked this lab is because I was able to see how we can change coding into a movable image. Not only did we make a movable image we were also able to make an 
image with one big square with one little square being a different color. I also found it very interesting how this lab contained some physics behind it by making the image resemble how 
we as people view images and how those images are formed by little particles when looked at with enhanced imagery.

Lab 6: The second lab I will be talking about is lab six. I enjoyed lab six because in part one we were able to use coding to make the ingredients to make a sandwich, and saying what we 
wanted in it as well. I was not to familiar with this lab but my partner was able to help me out and I was able to get the understanding on how to use Vector in that way

Lab 9: The last lab I will be talking about is lab nine, in this lab it was very complicated and one of the most difficult for me. This lab was interesting to me because 
it was not too much to deal with. When doing these labs I mostly expect a lot but for this one it was straightforward, the main points of this lab were to make a game creative in a way 
by making a number secret.
